## Hello World!
I'm __BeatsPerHour__, or just __Beats__ if you want, and I am a hobby hacker, ethically of course, who somethimes writes bots to flood phishing sites with fake account informations to make the account list they gather useless and sometimes I accidentally crash their site in the process.

### Why am I doing that?

I believe that the Internet is a powerful tool that should be used for good and that everybody should do their part to keep it safe and clean, which is why I try to stop scammers and protect other people from being taken advantage of.

### Is this illegal?

Theoretically it is, but because the things the scammers do is illegal too it should be fine.
