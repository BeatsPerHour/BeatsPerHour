Hello fellow individual, glad you made it to the github profile of BeatsPerHour (BPH), your go-to source for tackling online scams and fraudulent activities on YouTube and the web. I'm dedicated to safeguard the online community from cyber threats and financial scams. 

## About me

I'm a passionate hobby developer with a mission to make the internet a safer place. My primary focus is on identifying and reporting:

- **Scam Livestreams on YouTube**: Ever noticed the sheer amount of scam livestreams on YouTube? That's where I come in! I actively monitor YouTube for scam livestreams and promptly report them to help protect viewers from falling victim to fraudulent schemes.
- **Fraudulent Websites**: I investigate and track down the websites these livestreams may direct viewers to. My goal is to shut down these malicious websites and disrupt their operations.
- **Cryptocurrency Scams**: If crypto addresses are involved in scams, I report them on <a href='https://www.chainabuse.com'>chainabuse</a> to warn potential victims.

## How I Work

My process involves:

1. **Identification**: I'm constantly scanning YouTube and the web to locate scam and malicious activities. To make this easier I'm working together with a friend of me, to develop a program that can easily identify scam livestreams. Currently, we have a pretty good system in place and are continuously working on improvements and bug fixes.
2. **Reporting**: Reporting scam livestreams to YouTube, fraudulent websites to hosting providers, domain registrars, and other relevant entities to ensure quick action thus minimizing any potential financial loss.
3. **Crypto Address Tracking**: If crypto addresses are involved in scams, I report them on <a href='https://www.chainabuse.com/profile/BeatsPerHour'>chainabuse [BeatsPerHour]</a> to warn potential victims.

## Get Involved

If you're passionate about online security and want to contribute to this important mission, here's how you can gat involved:
- **Hunt Scammers Yourself**: Basically everything I make is really easy to do yourself, so why don't you try it out yourself? (Planning on publishing a guide explaining how to search, identify and report cyber crime)
- **Contact Me**: If the first point isn't your thing, then how about contacting me with any suspicious sites you find? See **Contact** for informations how you can reach me.
- **Spread Awareness**: Share information and news about scams and safety tips with your friends, family and people online. Keeping them informed is the best way to protect them.
